/**
 * Instantiate an anonymous js object.
 *
 * Therefore this method should only be used with external interfaces to initialize memory
 * ## Warning: You have to initialize all non-nullable properties!
 * Otherwise you *will* get a NullpointerException on the first read
 *
 *
 * ### Example
 *
 *     external interface Foo {
 *         var name : String
 *     }
 *
 *     var peter = jsObject {
 *         name = "Peter"
 *     }
 *
 *
 * Is the same as the following js snippet
 *
 *     let peter = {
 *         name = "Peter"
 *     }
 *
