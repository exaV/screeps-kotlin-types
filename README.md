### Extensions

Besides the types, 
the package *screeps.utils.** holds some useful functions for playing screeps with Kotlin.
Some notable utilities are documented below:

Lazy properties adapted for Screeps:

    val expensiveToCompute: Int by lazyPerTick { <code executed at most once per tick> }
        

Memory delegates:  
The function `memory()` creates a delegated property that is saved to memory. 
Such properties can only be created on objects that have access to memory such as `Creep.memory` or `Flag.memory`.
By convention all types that have access to memory inherit from the `MemoryMarker` interface.

    var CreepMemory.priority: Int by memory { 0 }
    // access later with creep.memory.priority
     

Optional arguments to api functions:

     PathFinder.search(origin,goal, options {
            flee = true
        })
